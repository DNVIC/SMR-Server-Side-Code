How to use my sketch system:

Create a scene with window captures with names starting with 0 to however many screens you want on stream (I usually put them in layouts with powers of 2 with one extra, where if there are 4 people competing you use 3 captures and the slowest person is not on the restream, while if there are 5 people, everyone is on the restream

Install the OBS
